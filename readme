Frequency accurate modeling of a Neve 1073 filter stage combined with an input gain-compensated saturation.
Designed by cascading ~30 peq/butterworth filters to reproduce frequency response, bumps and drops of the original console strip.
Input saturation based on "arctan" modeling, which is gain-compensated. Includes additional independant gain trimming.

Controls :
- Left mouse button to change knob value, right mouse button resets control.
- Frequency bands for Mid and Low and gain trimming is done using mouse wheel.

Versions :
- Beta 0.91 - Low Shelf GUI Fix and Sat mouse speed increase by 25%
- Beta 0.9 - First release

To Do :
- Implement parameter smoothing to avoid glitches during automation,
- Fixing Freq display for low shelf,
- Saturation increments with mouse control,

Dependecies :
